# Data Migration Summary

## What Has Been Accomplished

1. **File Structure Reorganization**
   - Split large `timeAuditData.ts` file into smaller, manageable files
   - Created a modular structure in `src/data/timeAudit/`
   - Separated types, common data, and industry-specific data

2. **Industry Files Migration**
   - Created individual files for each industry in `src/data/timeAudit/industries/`
   - Fully migrated and enhanced 10 industries with the 4-part question structure:
     - Construction
     - Restaurant
     - Legal Services
     - Real Estate
     - Accounting & Finance
     - Healthcare
     - IT & ITSM
     - Retail & Ecommerce
     - Professional Services
     - Automotive

3. **Enhanced Questions Structure**
   - Implemented the 4-part question structure:
     - Task Question (original timeEstimate)
     - Method Question (how the task is performed)
     - Satisfaction Question (how satisfied with current process)
     - Challenges Question (what challenges are faced)
   - Added transaction-based questions with frequency tracking

4. **UI Enhancements**
   - Updated StepQuestions.tsx with conditional logic for:
     - Method/Satisfaction/Challenges questions
     - Frequency questions for transaction-based tasks

5. **Migration Tools**
   - Created a migration script to assist with extracting industries
   - Created documentation for the migration process

## What Still Needs to Be Done

1. **Complete Industry Migration**
   - Apply the 4-part question structure to the remaining 16 industries
   - Follow the pattern established in the migrated industries
   - Consider transaction-based tasks and add frequency questions as appropriate

2. **Integration & Testing**
   - Test all migrated industries thoroughly
   - Ensure the conditional logic works correctly for all question types
   - Verify that the transaction frequency questions appear and disappear appropriately

3. **Results Calculation Enhancement**
   - Update `calculatePotentialSavings` in `StepResults.tsx` to:
     - Use frequency answers for transaction-based tasks
     - Include hourly rate in calculations
     - Calculate financial impact based on time estimates

4. **Results Display Update**
   - Enhance the results display in `StepResults.tsx` to show:
     - Time savings breakdown
     - Financial impact based on hourly rates
     - Potential annual savings

## Future Improvements

1. **Method-Based UI Enhancement**
   - Consider further refinement of the UI based on method answers
   - Provide more targeted follow-up questions based on specific methods

2. **Calculation Improvements**
   - Enhance calculation logic to provide more nuanced savings estimates
   - Consider industry-specific factors in calculations

3. **Visualization Enhancements**
   - Add charts or graphs to visualize potential time and cost savings
   - Compare current vs. optimized processes
